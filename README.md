## MyQAProject

# My Java project
I have created an application for a voting site. Users are able to register their details and vote for candidates. Their information can be logged and counted to collect data on voters.

# Why are we doing this?
The ojective for this project is to display coding skills and project management learned during the QA DFESW10 Software Development course. The project is to create a backend program with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality using MySQL, Spring, Java, Git and GitHub, Jira.

# How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected to face a lot of hurdles and was quite daunted by the database aspect but initialising a database through spring made everything much easier.

# What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
Creating CRUD functionalty was relatively simple however linking another table from my database to include another method and feature was extremely difficult. 

# Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
Add voting feature as seperate to user account creation so more information on  voting choice can be taken. Include registration and sign on feature to allow users to keep account for future polls.

# Risk Assessment
I have spent long hours working on my code which can exacerbate certain risks such as:
- Back pains due to poor posture and sitting for long hours
- Degredation of sight/Strain on eyesight due to many hours of looking at a screen (even more so if in a dark room)
- Overheating laptop/computer either resulting in breakage or fire.
- Procrasination due to easy access of internet and other distracting elements
- Increased stress/blood pressure/anxiety due to code not working of missing of deadline.
